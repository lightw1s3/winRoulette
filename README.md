# winRoulette
Powershell script to search for privilege elevation methods


###### Complete usage
All script functionalities are active except the Check-PasswordsFilesDir function discussed under the Check-PasswordsPrivs function. This function allows to search under the root disk directory for files whose name or content may contain passwords. It is disabled by default because it takes a long time, but if you wish, you can disable it to run it.
